# EvoSim

My first project. Desperately in need of an overhaul.

This visually simplistic program simulates evolution of randomly generated blobs as they multiply and mutate to adapt to their environment!

Food matter will continuously generate at random throughout the level until reaching a specified maximum level.

Living creatures will randomly spawn while the global population is below 10.
If a species manages to spawn more than 10 offspring, spawning will stop, and reproduction is the only method of population increase.

Graphs can be viewed to get an idea of life in the environment over time, and a number of options in the menu to the side allow you to interact or observe with your very own ecosystem.
